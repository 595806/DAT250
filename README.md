# Technical Problems
## Development Environment
During the expass1 I did not encounter any problems, however when I started on expass2 I experienced issues with using Visual Studio code, this cause me to switch to InteliJ. The switch took a long time as I had issues with my Java and Gradle as I used WSL to install these. To fix this I had to have the project directory inside the WSL file structure, this fixed the gradle/java problem with InteliJ
## Unsolved
I did not prioritize solving task 6 and 7 due to time constraints caused by development environment issues.

# Solved
The task 1-5 is solved and fully tested, I implemented automated testing with jupiter unit testing with RestClient.
Manual testing was done with InteliJ's httpclient.
